  changed:
    - "`ROM::HTTP::Gateway` tries to load the `Dataset` class lazily from the same namespace
      that the `Gateway` is defined in, with a fallback to `ROM::HTTP::Dataset`, making
      extending easier (AMHOL)"
    - "`ROM::HTTP::Gateway` no longer raises errors on missing configuration keys, these
      are now raised late in `Dataset` - this was to allow for the implementation of
      `default_request_handler` and `default_response_handler` (AMHOL)"
    - "`ROM::HTTP::Dataset` now uses `ROM::Options` from `rom-support`, adding typechecking
      to options and making it easier to define additional options in extensions"
